Learn2Earn - AI Mentor

1. Scenario : 
Riya is a 2nd-year Computer Science student who feels lost. She's scored decently in college, has 
watched a few YouTube tutorials, but doesn't know what skills are actually needed to become a 
Data Analyst — her dream job. There’s no proper guidance in college, and every other website 
gives her generic advice. She needs a tool that looks at her current level and tells her exactly 
what to do next — like a GPS for her career. 
2. Objectives : 
• Develop a platform that: 
  • Assesses the student’s current skills (via quizzes, uploaded portfolio, resume, past 
courses, or self-declared info) 
  • Asks or helps the student choose a career goal 
  • Generates a step-by-step learning roadmap personalized to that student’s level 
  • Integrates resources from pla`orms like YouTube, Coursera, edX, and offline PDFs 
  • Provides progress tracking and sugges@ons based on weekly achievements 
  • Op@onal bonus: Include peer comparison, mentor sugges@ons, or industry-aligned 
certifications
